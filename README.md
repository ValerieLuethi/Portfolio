## Database Management
- Book Recommender System (MySQL)

## DevOps
- **Programming Three Games (Hangman, Battleship, UNO)** (Python, Git, GitHub, Pylint, MyPy, Docker)
Developed three fully functional games as part of a team of five, focusing on best coding practices, collaborative version control, and cloud deployment using Docker containers. *(Code repository is private due to course policies)*
