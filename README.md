| [Webscraper for Pizza Prices in Major Swiss Cities](https://github.com/ValerieLuethi/CIP_FS25_201)                              |  April 2025     | Python, pandas, BeautifulSoup, seaborn, matplotlib |  In this group project, we scraped Pizza Margherita prices from an online delivery service across ten major Swiss cities, then analysed and visualised the data. We focused on three questions: <ul><li>which cities have the highest and lowest prices?</li><li>which factors influence restaurant ratings?</li><li>how do pizza prices relate to regional median income through a “Pizza Margherita Index”?</li></ul>                 |
